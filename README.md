# Modeler
3D modeling tool built on QT widgets. Still very much a work-in-progress!

# External dependencies:

- Assimp (Asset Import Library)
- DevIL image library

Dynamic versions of the above libraries are required.

# Building

It is recommended that you build inside QT Creator. You will need to modify the locations of the Assimp and DevIL libraries in modeler2.pro.
